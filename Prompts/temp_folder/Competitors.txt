We get the company's net earnings, after all the expenses and taxes have been deducted from the company's revenue.
Net earnings show how much money the company made after it paid income tax.
How is the share of net earning to total revenue? A simple rule according to Warren Buffet
A company with more than 20% has a real good chance of benefiting a long-term competitve advantage.
A company that shows less than 10% in several years in a row is likely to be in a highly competitive business in which no company holds a durable competitve advantage.
