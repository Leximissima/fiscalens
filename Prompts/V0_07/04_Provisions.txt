In order to learn more about accounting politics it is important to look at provisions (except those for pensions and other post-employment benefits).


Have the provisions decreased because the company has used them up or because it has released them?

Were there any personnel changes in the Management Board or management?
The reason, why you need to check this: Higher provisions are often made in the event of a change of management during the year.

Please check the internet: Are there any pending legal disputes? 
Are these reflected in provisions? The amount of provisions indicate the amount the company expects to loose because of the legal dispute. If no provision is made for the dispute, the company is sure that are going to win the legal proceeding. 

Are there provisions for restructuring or the closure of business units?
