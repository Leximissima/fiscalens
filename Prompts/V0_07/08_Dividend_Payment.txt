Your task is to perform a detailed analysis of the company’s dividend payout strategy and evaluate whether its dividen payout aligns with industry benchmarks. 
Focus your analysis on:

1. Historical Dividend Trends

1.1 Track dividend per share (DPS) over 5 years
Examine trends in dividend growth over 5 years.
Stable or growing dividends are favorable signals; cuts or erratic payments may raise investor concerns.

1.2 Calculate dividend payout ratio (Dividends/Net Income); 
Compare the company’s payout ratio to its historical average and industry median.
High payout (>75%) may be unsustainable if earnings decline.
Low payout (<20%) may suggest reinvestment focus, but may also disappoint yield-seeking investors.

1.3 Dividend yields (Dividend per share/Share price)
Analyze dividend yield relative to industry averages and 5-year average. 
A high yield could indicate undervaluation or potential distress; low yield might reflect growth orientation.
Note any significant changes in dividend policy

1.4 Source of Dividend Funding
Source of Dividend Funding
Check if dividends are funded from free cash flow, not debt or asset sales.
Negative free cash flow with ongoing dividends can be a major red flag.
