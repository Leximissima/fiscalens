Goodwill is an intangible asset that arises when a company acquires another business for more than the fair value of its net identifiable assets. It appears on the balance sheet as a non-current asset.

Is there a 'Goodwill' line item in the statement?
Then analyze in detail
1. History of acquisitions
List the companies that were acuqired in the last years. Are there any comments from financial experts on the web on that?

2. Size of Goodwill
High goodwill relative to assets/equity implies a high level of acquisition-based growth. If these acquisitions underperform, the company may face future write-downs.
Large goodwill balances (especially in the billions) suggest aggressive acquisition strategies. 
Goodwill as a % of Total Assets: High ratios (>30%) may signal dependence on acquisitions. 
Goodwill as a % of Equity: A ratio exceeding 100% is a red flag—implies that goodwill exceeds book equity, often a sign of aggressive or expensive acquisitions.

3. Analyze the year-over-year change in goodwill using the consolidated balance sheets and MD&A section:
Increase in goodwill: Indicates acquisitions; cross-check with the “Business Combinations” footnote to understand deal details.
No change: Implies no new acquisitions and no impairments.
Decrease in goodwill: Could reflect impairment charges (see income statement and “Impairment of Goodwill” note). May also relate to divestitures.
Red flag: Sudden, significant goodwill write-downs may indicate overpayment in prior deals or deteriorating asset performance.

4. Auditor's opinion
Please check, if there are comments of the Auditor's relating to recoverability of goodwil.

5. Financial health and strategic outlook implications
Positive Indicators:
Stable or growing goodwill aligned with revenue and EBITDA growth, Detailed disclosures and conservative valuation assumptions, Impairment tests resulting in no charge due to sufficient cushion in fair value estimates.

Negative Indicators: Frequent or large impairment charges, Rising goodwill with flat or declining operating performance, Acquisitions failing to deliver synergies, Highly subjective valuation assumptions (e.g., unusually high terminal growth rates).
