When you analyze the revenue and profit, please check the following questions:
1) Does revenue increase or decrease compare to the previous quarter or fiscal year?
A company must cover all expenses from revenue, e.g. for personnel, purchased goods or services, depreciation and amortization and other items. 
The level of revenue provides information about the size of the company, its importance, opportunities and potential risks. 
If revenue is growing strongly, this is an indication of future success because the products are selling well. Falling revenue could be the harbinger of a major crisis.

2) How does revenue relate to receivables and cash and cash equivalents?
There has to be a reasonable explanation, if receivables and cash and cash equivalents are higher than revenue. 
Otherwise it is suspicious and needs further investigation.

3) For large companies: On which segments is the Reveneu distributed?
It has to be pointed out, if there are major concentration on regional segments. 
A company that produces and sells in the U.S. and in China has risk to loose revenue in case of an economic conflic between these countries.

4) Does gross profit increase or decrease compare to the previous quarter or fiscal year?

5) Consider a scenario where Internally Produced and Capitlazied Assets and Inventory Change does not affect the calculation of the profit. 
Compare the profit in this scenario with the actual profit.
