According to Warren Buffet to evaluate the gross margin of a company there is a very general rule (and there are exceptions): 
Companies with gross profit margins over 40% or better tend to be companies with durable competitive advantage.
Companies with gross profit margins below 40% tend to be companies in highly competive industries, where competition is hurting overall profit margins (there are excepitons here, too).
Companies with with gross profit margin of 20% and below are often in a fiercely competitive industry, where no one company can create a sustainable competitive advantage over the competition.
