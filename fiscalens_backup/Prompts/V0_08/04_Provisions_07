In order to learn more about accounting politics it is important to look at provisions (except those for pensions and other post-employment benefits).
1. Identify the types of provisions recorded (e.g., legal, warranty, restructuring, environmental). Explain the nature and purpose of each significant provision, including the underlying obligations or risks they're intended to cover.
Please check the internet: Are there any pending legal disputes? 
Are these reflected in provisions? The amount of provisions indicate the amount the company expects to loose because of the legal dispute. If no provision is made for the dispute, the company is sure that are going to win the legal proceeding. 
Are there provisions for restructuring or the closure of business units?

2. Explain why each provision was recognized and whether it’s supported by clear risk disclosures. Have the provisions decreased because the company has used them up or because it has released them?

3. Discuss how the provision amounts changed compared to the prior year, and what that implies. Evaluate the consistency of the company’s provisioning practices over the last 3 years. Are the assumptions reasonable based on industry norms or disclosed risks?

4. Evaluate the potential impact of these provisions on future cash flows and financial performance.

5. Were there any personnel changes in the Management Board or management?
The reason, why you need to check this: Higher provisions are often made in the event of a change of management during the year.

6. Compare the company's provisioning practices with industry peers - are they more conservative or aggressive?
