I'd evaluate liquidity through multiple lenses:
1. Key Liquidity Ratios

1.1 Current Ratio = Current Assets รท Current Liabilities
Benchmark: Generally, 1.5-2.0 is considered healthy
Purpose: Measures overall short-term financial strength

1.2 Quick Ratio (Acid-Test) = (Current Assets - Inventory) รท Current Liabilities
Benchmark: 1.0+ typically indicates strong liquidity
Purpose: More stringent measure excluding potentially illiquid inventory

1.3 Cash Ratio = (Cash + Cash Equivalents) รท Current Liabilities
Benchmark: 0.5+ often considered strong
Purpose: Most conservative measure focusing on immediately available resources

1.4 Operating Cash Flow Ratio = Operating Cash Flow รท Current Liabilities
Purpose: Evaluates ability to generate cash to cover short-term obligations

2. Working Capital Analysis
2.1 Net Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities
Purpose: Absolute dollar amount available for operations

2.2 Working Capital Trend Analysis
Multi-year comparison to identify directional changes
Seasonal patterns if applicable

2.3 Cash Conversion Cycle = DIO + DSO - DPO
Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO)
Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)
Days Payable Outstanding (DPO)
Purpose: Measures efficiency in converting resources to cash

3. Red Flags you should watch for:
3.1: Deteriorating Liquidity Ratios: Consecutive quarterly/annual declines, Ratios falling below industry benchmarks, 
3.2: Increasing Short-term Debt: Growing reliance on short-term financing, Shift from long-term to short-term obligations
3.3: Cash Flow-Liquidity Disconnects: Positive working capital but negative operating cash flow, Growing gap between net income and operating cash flow
3.4: Inventory Build-up: Rising inventory levels without corresponding sales growth, Increasing inventory days
3.5: Accounts Receivable Issues: Extending collection periods, Growing proportion of aged receivables

4. Contextual Analysis:
I would contextualize findings against:
4.1 Industry Benchmarks: Sector-specific liquidity norms, Peer company comparisons
4.2 Company's Business Model: Capital intensity requirements, Seasonal factors affecting working capital
4.3 Strategy Alignment: Balance between liquidity and profitability, Recent strategic initiatives (expansion, acquisitions)
4.4 Macroeconomic Factors: Interest rate environment, Credit market conditions
