## How to Find the Path of Your Cloned GitHub Repository

To find out where your GitHub repository is cloned, you can follow these steps:

### Using Terminal

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where you think your repository might be located.
3. Use the `pwd` command (print working directory) to display the current directory path.

For example:
```sh
cd /path/to/your/github/repository
pwd
```

This will print the full path to your GitHub directory.

### Using Visual Studio Code

1. Open the repository in Visual Studio Code.
2. Right-click on the folder in the Explorer pane.
3. Select "Copy Path" to copy the full path to your clipboard.
